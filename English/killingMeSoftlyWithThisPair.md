_(A table. Behind the table, a huge portrait of "the Coach". The one who is never seen, but whose presence weighs, as the statue of the Commendatore. On the table, a computer, a video projector. The computer is plugged into the video projector, the audience can therefore see what JONATHAN and EMMANUEL are typing. JONATHAN is writing a program. Enters EMMANUEL. JONATHAN keeps on writing during the introductory text.)_

**EMMANUEL**  
Good day to you, and thank you for coming so numerous. Today we shall talk about a topic that concerns us all, and I am weighing my words. A topic that, unfortunately, too often remains taboo. How many teams, indeed, have wanted to honour scrupulously Saint Beck and apply His words to the letter: "All production code is written with two people looking at one machine, with one keyboard and one mouse... If two people pair in the morning, in the afternoon they might easily be paired with other folks." And the rascal adds: "More often, anyone on the team will do as a partner." More often, indeed. For how many coders have found themselves in that impossible situation where they had to put up with what we will politely call "the Other". That infernal other, who does not understand a bit of how one operates, or worse, who understands everything when one does not understand anything anymore, with their irritating impatience and their slight condescension, which keeps one awake at night, which makes one feel sorry not to have become an architect, a certifier, or better yet, a Product Owner.

We wanted to balance the scales back and share with you, beloved audience, the hope of a better world, in which one wouldn't have to pair with the pains-in-the-butt of all trades – without getting noticed.  To keep on programming with passion, while subtly suggesting to the evil pair how painful they are; to show them in all innocence the way out, while remaining under the radar of the Scrum Master.

Of course, we won't presume to have invented the close-combat tactics that follow. We're merely transmitters, from us to you, of well-proven techniques, which we hope will get you out of nightmarish situations of pair-programming. So with no further delay, let's bravely throw ourselves in the fight, and suit the action to the word.

_(EMMANUEL sits down next to JONATHAN. While JONATHAN speaks, EMMANUEL continues the code where he left off.)_


**JONATHAN**  
_(If a second keyboard is used, now is a good time for JONATHAN to make it disappear.)_  
Two types of strategies can be distinguished. Those applicable when you have the keyboard, those applicable when you don't. When you are the navigator, in short. Practice recognizing those situations, in order not to mistake them for one another and apply techniques that could, in an inappropriate context, prove disastrous to you.

You will quickly note that the driver's position is, for our subject, vastly more enjoyable. If you are not the driver, do what you must to become it. We will study the navigator's techniques subsequently. For now, it is sufficient to know that, as a first resort, you can easily become the driver by using the Majestic Lion technique, also known as the "Keyboard Grab".

_(JONATHAN grabs the keyboard from EMMANUEL's hands, majestically)._

**EMMANUEL**  
… 'the fuck?!

**JONATHAN**  
_(To the audience:)_ A first reflex: every time you take the keyboard, start off marking your territory, by erasing the last few lines entered by your future ex-partner.

_(He suits the action to the word, then codes.)_

**EMMANUEL**  
Let's study now a simple technique - which consists in coding without saying a word, most preferably on the red bar, for a couple of minutes.  Guaranteed effect.

_(EMMANUEL takes the keyboard back and codes. Long silence. JONATHAN keeps his cool.)_

**EMMANUEL**  
But.  _(JONATHAN takes the keyboard back and codes during the following.)_  If your pair is not only perfidious, but also armed with exemplary patience, do not hesitate to pause, confused, and to ponder for a while.  When your pair is about to speak up, in the foolish hope of breaking the excruciating silence and help you, cut them off and say "ah yes, I know."

_(A long pause. EMMANUEL about to speak up.)_

**JONATHAN**  
Ah, I know.

_(Then JONATHAN codes something furiously. Several repetitions of the same scene. Back to the green bar.)_

**EMMANUEL**  
Generally speaking, the red bar is your friend.  Of course, don't fall for the distasteful technique consisting in breaking something on purpose.  No.  Be more subtle.  Write a large test.  _(JONATHAN writes a large test.)_  Refactor on the red bar.  Specifically - fix parts of the code that have nothing to do with it.  On the red bar.  Mispellings.  On the red bar.  Curly brackets at end of line.  On the red bar.

_(Example.)_

**JONATHAN**  
When the other takes back the lead and the keyboard, _(EMMANUEL takes back the keyboard)_ for it will inevitably happen, do not fight. On the contrary, use this new context to your advantage, when they will be under the illusion of contributing, and therefore, less wary.

Let us use this opportunity to examine the navigator's strategies.

Sigh. Suggest that they are taking to much time to do what they are doing, whatever it is. With a little bit of patience, you should reach that crucial point where you will be able to point out every keyboard shortcut they are using or not, right when they are about to execute this or that command. If they break, you win. Demonstration.

_(Demonstration. EMMANUEL does not break.)_

**JONATHAN** _(carrying on)_  
If they do not yield, now would probably be a good time to start, always so subtly, slipping a few errors here and there in your navigating.

_(Demonstration. Then, to EMMANUEL:)_

**JONATHAN**  
Fuck, you're seriously too slow.

_(JONATHAN takes back the keyboard.)_

**EMMANUEL**  
Or - here is a very efficient alternative to "let me tell you what to type": "let me tell you what you've just typed."

_(Demonstration.)_

**EMMANUEL** _(pursuing)_  
Another dreadful technique consists in signaling every typo, right when they're written.  For sure, your pair will lose the thread of what they're typing, which will indicate when to get back to the sighing strategy.

_(Demonstration)_

**EMMANUEL** _(pursuing)_  
It will then probably be the time to grab back – majestically – the keyboard from their hands.  You'll have gained the initiative back, and you'll be able to code again in silence, on the red bar.  Don't forget the basics: mark your territory, erase what your pair has written.

_(EMMANUEL takes back the keyboard.)_

**JONATHAN**  
At this point, you should have gotten rid of all the coding killjoys, the test-inhibited, the sticky morons, the agile smurfs, and all those roughly normal idiots.
But. There will come times when your pair is devious enough to resist, particularly if they took a certifying Scrum Master course, or if they had training with Gerald Weinberg. The signs are unmistakable: if they want to bring about discussion and confront you on the field of words, maximum alert. Be on the lookout, with extreme suspicion, for moments when they will suggest a pause to discuss the design in a meeting room, or a code review. Do not let yourself be pushed around.

**EMMANUEL**  
So, Jonathan, how about we're taking a break, now?

**JONATHAN**  
Calmly, express your surprise and indignation.
_(To EMMANUEL:)_ The project is late already, no need to make it even more late.
_(To the audience:)_ Alternately, negotiate.
_(To EMMANUEL :)_ Ok for a pause, but you won't be hassling me afterwards with two days of code review just because I had to code late at night to make up for lost time.

_(During next EMMANUEL's lines, JONATHAN writes the correct code as a one-liner.)_

**EMMANUEL**  
The terms "making up", "time" and "lost" are your allies. As soon as your are off the red bar, they will help you get back there in no time.

_(He closes the laptop.)_

Obfuscation, confusion, misunderstandings - here are your trump cards.  Know when to take advantage of them.  Whatever happens, make sure your pair programming sessions are vague to the extreme, keep the goals hazy and inconsistent.

**JONATHAN**  
Complain before your partner has failed. Document their weaknesses, patent and latent. Record, record, record. Have no mercy. Never forgive, never forget.

**EMMANUEL**  
Never justify.  Shoot first.  Accuse the other to sabotage the pair programming session.

_(More and more intensely.)_

**JONATHAN**  
Surprise them. Throw cries of pain. Eat crisps. Trim your nails.

**EMMANUEL**  
Over the keyboard.

**JONATHAN / EMMANUEL** _(a joined, cathartic scream)_  
AAAAAH !

_(An awkward pause.)_

**EMMANUEL**  
Allright, shall we get back to it?

**JONATHAN**  
Back to what ?

**EMMANUEL**  
Well, to the pair programming session, here, now.

**JONATHAN**  
No way, there's no time left.

**EMMANUEL**  
Really?

**JONATHAN**  
Nope, no time at all.

**EMMANUEL**  
Right but –

**JONATHAN**  
No. We're done. _(To the audience:)_ So that's it for this intro session. Thank you for your attention. Thank you for staying, I mean those who stayed… Don't hesitate to contact us if you have questions. So we also offer advanced training on the subject, you see, including accessory handling. A two days course, you can probably get your employer to subsidize it, so we have one day on the use of a mobile phone during pairing sessions, and then another day on the use of office supplies and potted plants.

That's it.

**EMMANUEL**  
Thanks.

**JONATHAN**  
Good bye.

**EMMANUEL**  
And good luck.



_(The End)_
